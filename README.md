**MonkeyPox is one of the most important medical topics on the international scene at the present time, along with climate change, Covid-19, and many other points.**

**In the repo of data, I divided it into many studies, it contains each study on Monkeypox chickenpox data with one of the other diseases and divided it as follows:**

* **study 1 contain Monkeypox VS Measles**
* **study 2 contain Monkeypox VS Chickenpox**
* **study 3 contain Monkeypox VS Normal**
* **study 4 contain Monkeypox VS Measles VS Chickenpox VS Normal**
* **study 5 contain Monkeypox VS Others**

**Study 4 is a challenge because it will require the construction of a nervous network that is able to differentiate between 4 different patterns of data**

**Study 5 is really interesting, which is a grouping of both measles, Chickeenpox and Normal in one file as they were one style of data, 
and this is to test an advanced nervous network building that can separate the previous three types and the main type, which is the monkeys.**

* MonkeypoxandMeasles Study contain Monkeypox VS Measles

**MonkeypoxandMeasles This study has already used it and built some beautiful nervous networks on it and the results I got are very good.**
